### How can I apply ML to my life?
 - Trending Skill for Data Scientists
 - Contribute to the field of Artificial Intelligence (build your own C3PO for example)
 - ML used for app recommenders - Learning from pattern recognition (Products from Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc)
 - Computer Vision - Autonomous Cars, Drones, Image Recognition
 - Natural Language Processing - Digital Voice Assistant - Smart Speaker
 - Neural Networks - Deep Learning - a subset of Machine Learning - Facial Recognition

### What skills do I need?

 - Statistics, Python, Business, Communication/Visualization

### How long does it take to learn ML?
- ML is a long journey. At least 10,000+ hours is the short answer (5-10 years full time)
- You can make a serious impact in a year by dedicating a few hours a day with these resources.

### How to Study
 - Find your motivation(why)
 - Find some friends to stay motivated (for example, Meetup Who)
 - Choose a discipline - machine learning has lots of free resources (What)
 - Express your progress daily and weekly (for example, Github/Youtube When & Where)
 - Follow a curriculum (How)
